# Hi there 👋 I'm Ben

**Data Scientist & Analytics Leader** with 7 years building systems that power business operations and strategic decision-making.

I've led development of automated reporting systems, advanced ML models, and managed end-to-end data pipelines. At Summersalt, I grew to managing the full data stack (Stitch, dbt, GCP, LookML, Looker, custom web apps) and owned the metrics layer powering their BI ecosystem. I've built LSTM forecasting models predicting net revenue with >96% accuracy, web scraping pipelines processing thousands of job descriptions, and production LLM integrations. I'm always focused on making data systems clear, connected, and built for impact.
